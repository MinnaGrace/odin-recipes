                Tenderize with a meat mallet.Season each side and dredge it in flour.
                Sear in olive oil and set aside. Deglaze the skillet with white wine and reduce by half.</li>
            <li>
                Add butter and garlic. Add flour and stir continuously. 
                Add half and half, chicken broth, and seasonings in small splashes.
            </li>

            <li> Bring to a gentle bubble, then reduce to a simmer. 
                Cover partially while you boil the pasta to al dente. 
            </li>

            <li> 
                Stir in the cheese over low heat, then add the pasta, followed by the chicken. 
                Stir to combine. Add a splash of pasta water to smooth it out if it's thicker than preferred.
